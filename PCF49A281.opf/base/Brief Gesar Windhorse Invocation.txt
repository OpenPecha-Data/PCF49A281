Brief Gesar Windhorse Invocation
by Mipham Rinpoche

hung, tashi lungta nyenpé baden ché
Hūṃ! The great flag of the windhorse, auspicious and sweet‑sounding far and wide
kunzang chöpé trin chen trowa di
Sends out a vast cloud of exquisite offerings, like those of Samantabhadra.
tsa sum sungma drala zodor dang
Through this offering, may the Three Roots—guru, deva and ḍākinī—protectors, dralas, and gods
in action,
go shying kyobpa chöpé drön gyur sok
And all you guests who care for and protect us—
khyepar gesar norbu dradul tsal
Especially you, Gesar Norbu Dradul Tsal,
dzutrul dorjé kyang gö perpo dang
With your miraculous, wild and skilful vajra steed,
patul dangmen kadö ponyar ché
Your fearless warriors, ladies, attendants and envoys—
sol lo chö do samdön lhündrub dzö
Cause all our aspirations to be spontaneously fulfilled!

This brief windhorse invocation was composed by the one called Mipham in a hermitage in Rudam
on the auspicious occasion of the tenth day of the ninth month. Maṅgalaṃ. May virtue abound!
