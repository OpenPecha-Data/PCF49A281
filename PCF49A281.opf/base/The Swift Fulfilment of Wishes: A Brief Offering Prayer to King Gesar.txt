The Swift Fulfilment of Wishes: A Brief Offering Prayer to King Gesar
by Mipham Rinpoche

The offering prayer to King Gesar that swiftly fulfils wishes is as follows:
hung, ying né tukjé mayel sengchen jé
Hūṃ! From out of all-pervading space, your compassion unwavering, the Great Lion, Lord Gesar,
tsa sum kündü norbu dradul tsal
You who embody all gurus, devas and ḍākinīs: Jewel Who Subdues Foes,
chökyong dralha wermé khor dangché
Together with your assembly of protectors, dralas and wermas,
tukjé tukdam wang gi dir shek la
Through the force of your compassionate pledge, come now,
damdzé dütsi tormé chöpa shyé
And accept these offerings of samaya substances, amṛta and torma;
drubpé taktsen ngö su tenpa dang
Show us real signs of accomplishment,
rewé drebu yishyin drubpar dzö
And fulfil all our hopes and aspirations.
chok dang tünmong ngödrub tsal du sol
Grant us supreme and ordinary siddhis, we pray!
om maha singha mani radza saparivara idam balingta khahi
oṃ mahāsiṃha maṇirāja saparivāra idam baliṃ te khāhi

This was composed during the ninth month of the Wood Monkey year (1884). There is nothing that
cannot be accomplished by praying assiduously in this way. Blessings and accomplishment
will follow thick and fast! Maṅgalam.
