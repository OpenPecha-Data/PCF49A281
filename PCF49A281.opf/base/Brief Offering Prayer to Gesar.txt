Brief Gesar Prayer
by Trulshik Dongak Lingpa

so so
So! So!
kyechok gesar chö dang dren tsam gyi
Supreme being Gesar, by making offerings and simply by thinking of you—
par té shyennang malü wang du dü
Outwardly, all external phenomena, without exception, are brought under control.
tsur té rangsem nangwa wang du dü
Inwardly, all the perceptions of our own minds are brought under control.
shyi jé samdön malü lhündrub dzö
At home and abroad, may all our wishes, every single one, be spontaneously fulfilled!
ki ki | so so | lha gyal lo

When the supreme being Gesar, together with his forces, appeared to me, Trulshik Dongak Lingpa,
in a vision these words arose spontaneously. They may not be elegant, but I have altered
nothing.
