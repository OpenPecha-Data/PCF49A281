Short Windhorse Prayer to Gesar
by Mipham Rinpoche

hrih, getsen lungta nyenpé baden ché
Hrīḥ! The great flag of windhorse, heralder of fortune and fame,
dögu künjung chöpé trinpung di
Sends out offering clouds, supplying all that is desirable,
gesar kyé bu khor dang ché la bul
Which we offer to you, great being Gesar, together with your retinue:
samdön kün drub chok lé namgyal dzö
Cause all our wishes to be fulfilled and grant us victory over all!

This was arranged by the one called Mipham on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Wood Snake
year (1905). Sarva maṅgalam!
